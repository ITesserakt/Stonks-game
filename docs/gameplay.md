## Gameplay Description

You need to go to the exchange, where you can buy game items. Your task is to watch for price changes in order to buy goods below the market (starting) price. Dynamic graphics will help you with it. **Try it!**

After purchasing another stonks item, your balance will not grow, so you should go to the inventory tab, where you can set new prices for the goods you bought. 

Then you are free to come up with your own tactics to achieve your first *million*. Pay attention to the behavior of the bots to find patterns (or just look at the code of the bots).

Also, don't forget about the tax system, which will always decrease your balance. Therefore, do not monitor prices for a long time.

If you are tired of the most dynamic gameplay, then you can look at the statistics tab, where you can watch your progress and a lot of funny information.

## Game Goals

Your goal is to reach a certain amount of money, which depends on your difficulty level. By quickly buying and selling items, you have the opportunity to win.

In this game, you can also lose if you make careless purchases and wait too long, so taxes will make NOT STONKS.
