# Stonks-game

## Description

Stonks Game is an exchange trading simulator. Here you should buy items and sell them at a new price. If your balance drops below 0, you lose. You win if you earn enough money depending on the current difficulty.

Also, there are several bots - little AIs which will mess you.

In the `shared` folder, you can find game config, save, and other stuff. Feel free to edit these things as you wish, but remember, you have to remove save after every config change.
